                    <p>I personally had the luxurious position to test a lot of materials at the BSO on the University
                        (Buitenschoolse Opvang) and at two primary schools at which I also needed to be at for my
                        Graduation Project. They had an extra STEM classroom with lots of kits I was priviliged to
                        experience first-hand.</p>
                    <p>And hey, who says childhood memories don’t count? I brought some of my own favorite building and
                        tinkering experiences to the table—because sometimes, the best learning starts with "What
                        happens if I…?"</p>

                    <p>As a kid of '98, programming toys were not as big yet as they are nowadays. Especially Friesland
                        seems to still lack two decades behind of the rest of the world... This means that the
                        programming toys I reviewed are with my biased sould that already knows some programming. Still
                        I was priviliged to discuss the products with a educational practioner, which gave me insights
                        in the toys being used at primary schools and after day cares.</p>

                    <div class="subtitle">Personal note.</div>
                    <p>For me, 'Free-Play' is a crucial aspect of toys <i>(Salem & Zimmerman, Rules of Play; Game Design
                            Fundamentals, 2004)</i>, not be confused with open-ended toys. Personally, I
                        have always preferred Lego Technic sets, which invite free play when the bricks are repurposed.
                        In contrast, a box of the same Lego pieces, which are open-ended, did not
                        engage me in the same way.<br>

                    <p>Thanks to this course, I now see what made several toys outstand to me and what not.

                        To me, a puzzle piece brick lacks the necessary context; without an initial framework, there is
                        nothing to build upon or exceed. I believe that having a starting context is essential, as it
                        allows me to develop and eventually outgrow that project, leading to more inventive creations as
                        I advance.

                                    Application can be considered similar than Duplo. Apart from
                                    the business setting, if the bricks could survive that long.

                                    each piece. Easy to clean, which is also a big plus. However,

                                    won't survive till adulthood. Some kits won't reach the stage of business settings.

                <p class="text-casestudies">As a kid, I had a fascination for mechanical structures, logic, but
                    also storytelling and a
                    friendly appearance. SnapCircuits would fit perfectly in this setup, as it appears less
                    intimidating. While I got into Arduino
                    lateron
                    anyways, I would have loved to play with the logic of electronics on a friendlier matter. On primary
                    school or maybe still in secondary school, I would have loved to have an Osmo Coding iPad as a
                    bridge between the snap circuits and the Arduino, just to not scare me with syntax.<br><br>

                    the pieces seemed less agressive to me, but ofcourse as I got older, Lego Technic provided more
                    possibilities and applications. Kapla and all other building blocks too fundamental didn't spark my
                    imagination as much as I got very intrigued by colors and storytelling with characters. Technical
                    toys didn't provide that in the same way as character based toys would. However, makedo and Byor
                    combined could have maybe bridged that gap, as there the kit is more of a piece, that is not
                    necessarily the end product: the cardboard shapes are.</p>

                            connections, in comparison to all kind of wires that Arduino or Byor provide. However it
                            would not be able to go to more advanced application, such as
                            (arduino obviously) would or even maybe Byor. In the end, I am probably more fond of the
                            Byor set
                            because of that, while I still loved this Kit for its friendliness.</p>

                <p>This set I was priviliged to observe the children of around 8 years old interacting with the kit. All
                    the physical pieces appeared quite logical to me and I was very intrigued about how this worked
                    internally; from a maker standpoint. However, that was not in scope ofcourse. I got to see how the
                    children walked routes in a maze and needed to pickup several items along the way with it. The
                    levels seemed quite straighforward, but got harder very fast. Even I as a
                    very-smart-person-doing-a-masters-in-engineering had to think twice sometimes. Very fun, but I am
                    not so sure on the retention: when I solved I puzzle, I immediately forgot it and went to the next
                    level. However, the children seemd quite fine, perhaps I got already outperformed by them.

                <p>Ahhh, the pieces I always had a love-hate relationship with. It focused on quite mechanical
                    challenges
                    which
                    made it's appearance quite unfriendly, the thing I also stayed for. Not the unfriendliness ofcourse,
                    the mechanical challenges. <br> At the school I had the chance to look into some booklets provided
                    with it and a tutorial on how to overcome some obstacle challenges. Very clear with tutorials and
                    everything.

                    <p>Building the interaction in motion, helped us determine the efficiency of the animation. I didn’t
                        want that animation to slow down the process of adding content. I used After Effects at first,
                        but
                        an HTML prototype gave a much better result when trying these interactions.</p>

                <p>Working on a quick prototype helps to clear certain phases in a project faster. These pieces were
                    brilliant for that. In the theme of spring, below you can see the easter bucket. This time build
                    without electronics, but I would have loved to create further on other projects with the Byor set
                    combined. There carboard crafting would become very interesting, while otherwise my Amazon Boxed
                    would have gone to waste from the getgo. Now they will be thrown away with emotional investment and
                    maybe as a prototype to world domination.</p>
